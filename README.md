# WearOS Research
Growing research document about [WearOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_OS)

## What is this?
This repo aims to document the inner workings of WearOS, Googles Android based operating system for smartwatches.

All research shown here is based on the version of WearOS that ships with a Pixel Watch 1. For other devices there might be subtle differences, but the core system should be largely the same.
